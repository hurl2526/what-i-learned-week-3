# **What I Learned Week 3**
## **Day 11**
Booleans true/false  

Loop true/false but can keep checking instead of one time only  

Binary operwtors take in two value:  

&& means both variables need to be correct/true for it to return the result true  

|| means or which means if either are true it will return the result true  

Unary operator takes in one thing:  

! before variable means Not. or False  

Typeof - takes in one variable 



=== Theyre the same  

!== Theyre different  

> first one’s greater  
>

>= greater or equal to

## **If statements**  
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}  

 
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.  

if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
